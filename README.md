# AdventOfCode
Solutions to the Advent of Code programming puzzles in C# .NET 5.

Originally forked from [ShootMe/AdventOfCode](https://github.com/ShootMe/AdventOfCode) to use their excellent infrastructure, utility classes, and puzzle class templating as a starting point.

All puzzle solutions are my work. Re-created this repo after 2021 Puzzle 8 so that my work on it shows up in my Contribution activity.
